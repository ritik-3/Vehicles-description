# Engine — Porsche 911 GT3 RS

## Engine & Performance 🔧⚡

**Overview:**
The Porsche 911 GT3 RS is powered by a naturally aspirated 4.0‑liter (3996 cc) flat‑six (boxer) engine derived directly from Porsche's motorsport program. It is tuned for high‑revving, track‑focused performance with exceptional throttle response and durability under prolonged high load.

**Key specifications:**
- **Displacement:** 4.0 L (3996 cc)
- **Configuration:** Naturally aspirated flat‑six (boxer)
- **Peak power:** ≈520 hp (model/year dependent)
- **Peak torque:** ≈346 lb‑ft (≈470 Nm)
- **Redline:** ~9,000 rpm
- **Induction:** Naturally aspirated with individual throttle bodies and race‑inspired intake tuning
- **Lubrication:** Motorsports‑grade (dry‑sump architecture on some variants)
- **Transmissions:** 6‑speed manual (standard) or 7‑speed PDK dual‑clutch (optional)

**Performance figures:**
- **0–60 mph:** ≈3.0 s (PDK typically slightly faster)
- **Top speed:** >193 mph (manufacturer/test dependent)
- **Track characteristics:** Linear, predictable power delivery; strong mid‑to‑high RPM pull; rewards high revs and driver skill; combined with aero and lightweight construction yields excellent lap times.

**Operational notes:**
- **Fuel:** Requires high‑octane/premium fuel for best performance and to avoid knock.
- **Consumption:** High under spirited or track use.
- **Cooling & durability:** Enhanced cooling, oiling, and materials for sustained high‑load operation; recommended adherence to track‑use maintenance schedules.

**Notes on model variations & tuning:**
- Power, torque, and some hardware (e.g., dry‑sump vs wet‑sump) can differ slightly by model year and factory options; aftermarket tuning and bolt‑on upgrades can raise power but may impact reliability and warranty.
