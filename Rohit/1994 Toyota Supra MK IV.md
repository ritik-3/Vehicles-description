Technical & Historical Notes
- The 2JZ-GTE is widely revered for its strong iron block and high tuning capacity; it is a common engine for high-horsepower builds and swaps.
- The Supra MK IV gained broad cultural prominence through motorsport, media, and tuning communities, boosting collectibility and aftermarket support.
- Reliability: with correct maintenance, the platform is durable; however, heavily modified cars require upgrades to clutch, drivetrain, and fuel systems.

Interior & Equipment
- Two-door coupe, driver-focused cockpit, sport seats; available leather, power accessories, climate control, cruise control depending on trim and market.
- Electronics are era-appropriate (no modern infotainment); safety features include airbags and optional ABS in many regions.

Common Modifications
- Turbo upgrades, larger intercooler, intake/exhaust improvements, ECU tuning, fuel system and clutch upgrades, suspension and brake enhancements.

Collector Notes
- Twin-turbo 2JZ-GTE Supras (especially low-mile, well-documented examples and limited editions) are highly sought after and command premium prices on the collector market.
- Parts availability is generally good due to popularity; OEM items can be pricier for rare/low-volume parts.

Sources & Further Reading
- Manufacturer specs and era brochures (Toyota)
- Enthusiast and tuning community resources (technical threads, build logs)
- Period road tests and performance reviews

If you want, I can:
- add a concise spec table with exact figures for US/Japan/EU market variants,
- include a short ownership checklist for buyers (common issues to inspect), or
- produce a short, publication-ready paragraph to use in listings.
