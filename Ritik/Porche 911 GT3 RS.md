# Porsche 911 GT3 RS

The Porsche 911 GT3 RS is a high-performance sports car manufactured by Porsche.

It is based on the Porsche 911 GT3 but features additional modifications for track use.

### Engine & Performance 🔧⚡

The GT3 RS is powered by a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter (3996 cc) flat-six (boxer) engine derived from Porsche's motorsport program. Key engine characteristics:
- **Peak power:** ~520 hp (varies slightly by year and options)
- **Peak torque:** ~346 lb-ft (≈470 Nm)
- **Redline:** ~9,000 rpm — one of the highest among production cars; the engine is designed to thrive at high revs.
- **Induction & breathing:** Naturally aspirated with individual throttle bodies and race-inspired intake tuning for immediate throttle response.
- **Lubrication & cooling:** Motorsports-grade oiling (dry-sump on some variants) and enhanced cooling to sustain prolonged high-load track usage.
- **Power delivery:** Linear and high-revving with strong mid-to-high rpm pull; power is concentrated at the top of the rev range which rewards keeping the revs high.
- **Transmission options:** 6-speed manual for maximum driver involvement or optional 7-speed PDK dual-clutch for lightning-fast shifts and better straight-line acceleration.
- **Performance figures:** 0–60 mph in about 3.0 s (PDK often slightly faster); top speed in excess of 193 mph; exceptional lap times due to the combination of power, low weight, and aero.
- **Fuel & consumption:** Requires premium fuel; fuel consumption is high during spirited driving or on track.
- **Track behavior:** Immediate throttle response, predictable power delivery, and strong braking compatibility due to torque curve and vehicle balance—ideal for experienced drivers seeking lap performance.

These engine and drivetrain choices make the GT3 RS exceptional in both raw lap performance and driver engagement.

The car weighs approximately 3,000 pounds, making it lightweight for its class.

It features a manual transmission as standard, with an optional PDK dual-clutch automatic.

The GT3 RS has a top speed of over 193 mph and can accelerate from 0-60 mph in about 3.0 seconds.

Aerodynamic enhancements include a larger rear wing and front spoiler for better downforce.

The interior is stripped down with lightweight materials to reduce weight.

It comes with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires for superior grip.

The braking system uses large carbon-ceramic discs for excellent stopping power.

The GT3 RS is designed primarily for track days and racing circuits.

It has a limited production run, making it a rare and desirable model.

Porsche offers the car in both coupe and convertible body styles.

The GT3 RS has won numerous awards for its performance and handling.

It represents the pinnacle of Porsche's GT racing heritage.

The car's design emphasizes balance and agility on the track.

Overall, the Porsche 911 GT3 RS is a masterpiece of engineering and performance.
