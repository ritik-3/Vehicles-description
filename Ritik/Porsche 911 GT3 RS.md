Since its debut in 2003, it has evolved through multiple generations, each pushing the boundaries of performance and aerodynamics.

## History and Evolution

The GT3 RS lineage began with the **996-generation GT3 RS** in 2003, inspired by Porsche's racing heritage, including the iconic Carrera 2.7 RS from the 1970s. It featured distinctive blue or red wheels and "GT3 RS" side stickers, emphasizing its racing pedigree. This model was not sold in the US or Canada, with only 682 units produced.

The **997-generation** brought significant updates, including a wider rear track and improved aerodynamics. The 997.1 GT3 RS (2006-2009) weighed 1,370 kg and produced 331 kW (450 PS). The 997.2 GT3 RS (2009-2011) increased power to 331 kW (450 PS), and the pinnacle 997.2 GT3 RS 4.0 (2011) delivered 368 kW (500 PS) with a 4.0-liter engine, limited to 600 units.
